Note:
The format of the hepatitis files did not match the format of the golf files. 
The golf files matched the specification more accurately and so in writing this program I edited the files to match that format.
The format is:

live die
attr1 attr2 attr3
val1 val2 val3
...  ...  ...

All files must be edited to match this format, I have included a copy of the hepatitis files with this change made.

Run from command line instructions:

1 ) Open terminal and navigate to the part2 directory
2 ) 'python DecisionTree.py hepatitis-training hepatitis-test'

The run-* files will be automatically run provided they are in the directory
